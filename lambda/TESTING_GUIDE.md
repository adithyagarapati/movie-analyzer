# Lambda Function Manual Testing Guide

Complete guide for testing the `movie-analyzer-sentiment` Lambda function manually before EKS integration.

## üéØ Testing Overview

After creating the Lambda function via AWS console, you should test:
- ‚úÖ **Health Check** - Function is running correctly
- ‚úÖ **Sentiment Analysis** - Core functionality works
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling** - Invalid inputs are handled
- ‚úÖ **Performance** - Response times are acceptable

## üìã Method 1: AWS Console Testing (Recommended)

## üéØ Real Movie Review Tests

Test with actual movie review examples:

**Positive Movie Review:**
```json
{
  "action": "analyze",
  "text": "The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece of storytelling. Morgan Freeman's narration is absolutely captivating, and Tim Robbins delivers a powerful performance. The film explores themes of hope, friendship, and redemption in a way that feels both profound and accessible. Every scene is carefully crafted, and the emotional payoff is tremendous. This is easily one of the greatest films ever made."
}
```

**Negative Movie Review:**
```json
{
  "action": "analyze",
  "text": "I was really disappointed with this movie. The plot was confusing and full of holes, the acting felt forced and unnatural, and the pacing was incredibly slow. I found myself checking my watch multiple times wondering when it would end. The special effects looked cheap and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. Would not recommend to anyone."
}
```

**Mixed Movie Review:**
```json
{
  "action": "analyze",
  "text": "The movie had some good moments and the cinematography was decent, but overall it felt like a missed opportunity. Some of the actors did well while others seemed to be just going through the motions. The story had potential but wasn't executed as well as it could have been. It's not terrible, but it's not great either."
}
```

## üöÄ Ready for EKS Integration?

If all tests pass successfully, your Lambda function is ready for EKS integration! 

**Next Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Verify all test cases pass
2. ‚úÖ Check CloudWatch logs for any errors  
3. ‚úÖ Note the function ARN for backend configuration
4. ‚úÖ Ensure IAM permissions are set correctly
5. ‚úÖ Proceed with backend integration in EKS

**Function ARN:** You'll need this for backend configuration:
```bash
# Get your function ARN
aws lambda get-function \
  --function-name movie-analyzer-sentiment \
  --region ap-south-1 \
  --query 'Configuration.FunctionArn' \
  --output text
```

üéâ **Your Lambda function is now tested and ready for production use!**
